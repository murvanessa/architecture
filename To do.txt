Traces files contain at leat 200000 memory accesses
    1) trace file of a program of your choice (for example the "ls" command) //fait install pin and do the same command as it is inside the file
    2) program tha multiples two large matrices // in process need to put comment and rearrange so that he can meet the evaluation criteria (correctness, quality of comments, organization)

cache simulator
      must simulate a 4-way associative memory cache with 64-byte cache blocks

      replacement policy: take  moodle correction
	In the project description, i have suggested to use an access flag for each slot. When
	the cache line is accessed, the flag is set. To make this working properly, slots would
	start with the flag not set. Furthermore, the flag should be reset periodically, otherwise
	it will often happen that all slots have the flag set after a few accesses. For a replacement
	the cache woulds preferably select a slot without the flag set.
	Alternatively, you can implement your own strategy, for example real LRU or LFU.
	In any cae, give a short description of your strategy in the project report

     write accesses should be treated as write-through-write-around. this basically means that your
     simulator can ignore write accesse because they do not affect the cache contents(however, they will
     set the access flag if the accessed block is in the cache)

     Stream prefetcher: if a cache block is read-accessed, the cache should prefetch automatically the
     next cache block.Note that the block might be already in the cache

Your program must accept the following parameters from the command line:
    file name of the input trace file
    number of cache rows
    a flag indicating whether prefetching is enabled(value 1) or disables(value 0)
    for example java Mychachesimulator trace.txt 16 1
    
the output
The simulator should print the achieved hit rate: A read access is a "hit" if the accessed location is 
in the cache. As already said, you can ignore write accesses

don't forget to read the remark about unsigned 64-bit numbers in java

the delivrable
single zip contain:
    the java source code of the simulator
    the C source code of your own program that you have traced with pin
    the report


the report
   report(A4, 11pt, PDF format, maximum 3 pages) contain
	1)the names of the group members
	2)an explanation what trace files have been used and how big they were
	3)figures/plots showing the hit rates obtained for the traces
		with differend cache sizes. Test cache sizes
		with and without prefetching
        4)a discussion on what would be a good cache configuration for your traces based of presented data in point 3
